## Summary

<!--
This section is incredibly important for producing high-quality, user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap. It should be
possible to collect this information before implementation begins, in order to
avoid requiring implementors to split their attention between writing release
notes and implementing the feature itself. KEP editors and SIG Docs
should help to ensure that the tone and content of the `Summary` section is
useful for a wide audience.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.

Both in this section and below, follow the guidelines of the [documentation
style guide]. In particular, wrap lines to a reasonable length, to make it
easier for reviewers to cite specific portions, and to minimize diff churn on
updates.

## Motivation

While `PreemptionConfig` provides declarative candidate selection policies, cluster administrators also need rate-limiting guardrails to prevent cascading preemptions, eviction storms, and cluster instability during large-scale rescheduling.

### Goals

1. Safe introduction of new `PreemptionConfig`s or rules within `PreemptionConfig`.
2. Increase of cluster stability by rate-limiting of preemptions.
3. Definition of most common fields that can be used to limit preemptions.

### Non-Goals

1. One advanced set of predefined `PreemptionLimit`s to fullfil every possible rate limiting use case.
2. Defaults for rate limiting current classical/fair sharing preemptions. (As those would be breaking)
3. Automatic addition of labels to existing Kueue resources (ClusterQueues, PreemptionConfigs).

## Proposal

This KEP proposes a new preemption rate limiting mechanism - for now supported only in Configurable Preemptions, but it can be extened also to the classic or fair sharing preemptions in the future.

Relevant capabilities include:

1. **Global rate-limiting**: Restrict the total number of preemption events across the entire cluster within a sliding time window.
2. **Preempting ClusterQueue rate-limiting**: Throttle preemptions triggered by workloads originating from a specific ClusterQueue.
3. **Preempted ClusterQueue protection**: Limit or block preemptions targeting workloads belonging to a specific ClusterQueue (e.g., setting `limit: 0` to make mission-critical or hero queues non-preemptible).
4. **Preempted Workload churn limiting**: Restrict how many times an individual workload can be preempted within a given time window to avoid starvation, ping-pong eviction loops or bullying of particular workload.

### User Stories

#### Story 1 - Safe rollout of experimental PreemptionConfig or new preemption rule

Mistakes in `PreemptionConfigs` can lead to serious consequences like mass evictions or cluster instability. By introducing rate-limiting of preemptions connected to a new `PreemptionConfig` or a new rule within existing config, can limit the blast radius of such misconfigurations. Cluster admins can at first set a small limit to a new rule/config and slowly increase it to the desired level, while observing cluster stability.

```yaml
spec:
  scope: "Global"
  limit: 1
  limitWindowDuration: "1h"
  configSelector:
    matchLabels:
      example.com/config-name: "experimental-preemption-config"
```

#### Story 2 - Protecting a workload from too many disruptions

Rate-limit preemptions of each workload in the cluster, so that it can be preempted only once per day to avoid bullying of a particular job by multiple preemptions.

```yaml
spec:
  scope: "PreemptedWorkload"
  limit: 1
  limitWindowDuration: "1d"
```

#### Story 3 - Global Preemption Rate Limiting

Rate-limit global preemptions to at most 10 evictions across the entire cluster in any 5-minute sliding window to avoid too many disruptions in the cluster:

```yaml
spec:
  scope: "Global"
  limit: 10
  limitWindowDuration: "5m"
```

#### Story 4 - Protecting a Mission-Critical ClusterQueue from Preemption

Ensure that workloads running in the `hero-cq` ClusterQueue can never be preempted by setting `limit: 0` under the `PreemptedClusterQueue` scope:

```yaml
spec:
  scope: "PreemptedClusterQueue"
  clusterQueueSelector:
    matchLabels:
      example.com/cluster-queue-name: "hero-cq"
  limit: 0
  limitWindowDuration: "1h"
```

### Caveats

As ClusterQueues right now do not have a constrained resource name to 63 characters and Kueue currently does not auto add labels to the Cluster Scope CRDs (K8 does this for Namespaces), this is up to the users to label cluster queues and appropriate preemption configurations themselves. This might be changed in the future to make the user experience better, but remains out of the scope of this KEP.

### Risks and Mitigations

As this feature is targeted to derisk Configurable Preemptions usage which is currently in Alpha it will be at first introduced only for the Configurable Preemptions. Thereby, as it will not in any way interfere with well matured preemption algorithms, the risks have small blast radius, and can be always mitigated by disabling Configurable Preemptions or Preemption Limits.

#### Performance degradation

Since this will increase complexity of configurable preemptions algorithm by checking if preemptions are allowed according to the limits, preemption performance monitoring is required to maintain appropriate level of preemption performance.

The risk will be mitigated by:

- PreemptionLimits are completely optional and can be disabled by removing them,
- performance testing before PreemptionLimits are graduated to Beta,
- short circuts in the implementation (e.g. if Global preemption limit is already reached for the particular PreemptionConfig, we do not need to check candidates for it at all),
- efficient implamentation of in memory tracking of past preemptions.

#### Security considerations

As preemption limits will be modifiable only by cluster administrators, there are no security risks introduced by this feature. Administrators modifying them should be aware of the risks and consequences of misconfiguration in Kueue, which can lead to workloads not being scheduled and effectively blocked or cascading preemptions.

## Design Details

`PreemptionLimit` will be introduced as a cluster-scoped CRD:

```go
// PreemptionLimit is the Schema for the preemptionlimits API
type PreemptionLimit struct {
	metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`

	// metadata is the standard object metadata.
	// +optional
	metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`

	// spec defines the desired state of the PreemptionLimit.
	// +optional
	Spec PreemptionLimitSpec `json:"spec"`

	// status defines the observed state of the PreemptionLimit.
	// +optional
	Status PreemptionLimitStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`
}


// PreemptionLimitScope specifies the entity boundary for a preemption limit.
// Possible values are:
// - "Global": restricts the total number of preemption events across the entire cluster within the sliding time window.
// - "PreemptingClusterQueue": restricts the number of preemption events triggered by workloads originating from a specific ClusterQueue within the sliding time window.
// - "PreemptedClusterQueue": restricts the number of preemption events targeting workloads belonging to a specific ClusterQueue within the sliding time window.
// - "PreemptedWorkload": restricts how many times an individual workload can be preempted within the sliding time window.
//
// +kubebuilder:validation:Enum=Global;PreemptingClusterQueue;PreemptedClusterQueue;PreemptedWorkload
type PreemptionLimitScope string

const (
	// GlobalPreemptionLimitScope restricts the total number of preemption events
	// across the entire cluster within the sliding time window.
	GlobalPreemptionLimitScope PreemptionLimitScope = "Global"

	// PreemptingCQLimitScope restricts the number of preemption events triggered by workloads
	// originating from a specific ClusterQueue within the sliding time window.
	PreemptingCQLimitScope PreemptionLimitScope = "PreemptingClusterQueue"

	// PreemptedCQLimitScope restricts the number of preemption events targeting workloads
	// belonging to a specific ClusterQueue within the sliding time window.
	PreemptedCQLimitScope PreemptionLimitScope = "PreemptedClusterQueue"

	// PreemptedWorkloadLimitScope restricts how many times an individual workload
	// can be preempted within the sliding time window.
	PreemptedWorkloadLimitScope PreemptionLimitScope = "PreemptedWorkload"
)
PreemptionLimitSpec defines the desired state of PreemptionLimit
type PreemptionLimitSpec struct {
	// scope specifies the entity boundary for this preemption limit.
	//
	// +required
	Scope PreemptionLimitScope `json:"scope,omitempty"`

	// configSelector selects PreemptionConfigs to which this limit applies.
	// If not set, it applies to all PreemptionConfigs.
	//
	// +optional
	ConfigSelector *metav1.LabelSelector `json:"configSelector,omitempty"`

	// clusterQueueSelector selects ClusterQueues to which this limit applies.
	// If not set, it applies to all ClusterQueues under the configured scope.
	//
	// +optional
	ClusterQueueSelector *metav1.LabelSelector `json:"clusterQueueSelector,omitempty"`

	// limit defines how many preemption events can occur within the given time window.
	// An event is defined as a confirmed (preemptor, preemptee) eviction pair.
	// Setting limit to 0 blocks all preemptions under this limit's scope.
	//
	// +required
	// +kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=0
	Limit int32 `json:"limit"`

	// limitWindowSeconds specifies the sliding time window duration, in seconds.
	// Must be greater than or equal to 1 to prevent sub-second thrashing.
	//
	// +required
	// +kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=1
	LimitWindowSeconds int32 `json:"limitWindowSeconds,omitempty"`
}

// PreemptionLimitStatus defines the observed state of PreemptionLimit
type PreemptionLimitStatus struct {
	// counts is periodically updated, for reference only.
	// Restricted to the top 1000 counts to fit within CRD size limits.
	//
	// +optional
	// +listType=atomic
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MaxItems=1000
	Counts []PreemptionLimitCount `json:"counts,omitempty"`
}
```

PreemptionLimit limits the number of preemptions that happen for the specified set of rules. The preemption evaluator evaluates proposed preemptions against defined limit objects, allowing them to proceed only if adequate preemption quota remains. If a preemption is in the scope of multiple limits, quota must exist in all of them.
To track this, a list of preemption rule names responsible for selecting each candidate must be maintained.

To manage this data, Kueue will store a comprehensive preemption map in memory, isolated per PreemptionLimit. This map tracks all preemption event timestamps under a specific CQ/workload key, capturing events that occurred within the designated `LimitWindowDuration`. Moreover, it tracks only events that are in the scope of the specific limit; if a preemption does not match the defined config or rules selector, it will not be tracked in that particular instance of the preemption map. This list is dynamically trimmed upon each retrieval to filter out expired timestamps.

Furthermore, the status of the PreemptionLimit is refreshed periodically — approximately every minute — to write the aggregated totals into the count map (restricted to the top 1000 counts to fit within CRD size limits).

### Observability When Reaching Preemption Limits

When preemption is throttled or blocked due to an exhausted `PreemptionLimit`:

1. **Workload Condition**: A condition with type `PreemptionBlockedByLimit` (reason `PreemptionLimitExceeded`) is assigned to the preemptor Workload, with an informative message indicating which limit blocked admission (e.g. `"Preemption was blocked by PreemptionLimit <limit-name>"`).
2. **Kubernetes Events**: A Kubernetes `Event` with reason `PreemptionThrottled` is emitted on both the preemptor Workload and its ClusterQueue.
3. **Structured Audit Logging**: Informational/debug log entries are recorded specifying the limit name, scope, and affected entities for operator troubleshooting.

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*
The goal is to ensure that we don't accept enhancements with inadequate testing.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

#### Prerequisite testing updates

<!--
Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.
-->

#### Unit tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.
-->

- `<package>`: `<date>` - `<test coverage>`

#### Integration tests

<!--
Describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

After the implementation PR is merged, add the names of the tests here.
-->

#### e2e tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, document that tests have been written,
have been executed regularly, and have been stable.
This can be done with:
- permalinks to the GitHub source code
- links to the periodic job (typically a job owned by the SIG responsible for the feature), filtered by the test name

If e2e tests are not necessary or useful, explain why.
-->

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- `PreemptionLimit` CRD is implemented allowing to specify the desired limits for configurable preemptions.
- `PreemptionLimit` allows narrowing down limits to specific `PremptionConfig`s.
- Existing behavior of not limiting classic and fairs sharing preemptions is maintained.
- Candidates from configurable preemptions are not selected if this would violate `PreemptionLimit`s in the cluster.

#### Beta

- Performance of enabling `PreemptionLimit`s is evaluated and does not lead to significant degradation of of preemption cadidates selection speed for up to 10 `PreemptionLimit`s in the cluster.
- Public documentation explains Preemption Limits, how can they be configured, and how they can be used to decrease risk of new `PreemptionConfig` rollouts.
- `PreemptionLimit`s support limiting only a subset of rules in the `PreemptionConfig`.
- Any bugs discovered during Alpha are fixed.

#### Stable

TBD

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

Increase of complexity of the PreemptionEvaluator - can be partially mitigated by the maintaining high quality of the code.

Increased memory footprint by tracking of preemption events for each limit.

Additional CRD to manage by the cluster administrator.

## Alternatives

1. Hardcoded preemption limits or flag based preemption limits for whole Configurable Preemptions.

   Rejected as this does not allow slow rule roll-out.

2. Specifing limits in the `PreemptionConfig` CRD.

   Rejected as this will make global limits either impossible or really unintuitive.

## Future Work Ideas

To allow safe evolution of the `PreemptionConfig`s, it would be best to add `ruleNames` field to the `PreemptionLimit`, that signalizes that the limit applies only to the specific set subset of rules.

Thanks to this users will be able to specify a strict limit for a new rule, which can be lifted when the rule stability in cluster is confirmed.

The addition to `PreemptionLimitSpec` would look like the following:

```go
	// ruleNames restricts the limit to specific rule names within matching PreemptionConfigs.
	// If not set, it applies to all rules.
	//
	// +optional
	// +listType=set
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MaxItems=64
	// +kubebuilder:validation:items:MinLength=1
	// +kubebuilder:validation:items:MaxLength=63
	// +kubebuilder:validation:items:Pattern="^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$"
	RuleNames []string `json:"ruleNames,omitempty"`
```

The caveat here is what should be the result of the preemption candidates selection when some candidate is selected by 2 rules:
A. Which would validate the preemption limit.
B. Which does NOT have the preemption limit.

It would be natural to allow it since it is still allowed by B, and would be selected as candidate if A did not exist at all.

On the other hand it would be inconsistent with the fact that multiple `PreemptionLimit`s are ANDed - if candidate would violate any of them it is not selected (e.g. Global limit and CQ specific limit).

Proposed approach: If there is a rule allowing preemption according to the limits - the preemption will be allowed but the resulting Condition will only mention rules that are not violating any limit. This preemption will also only count under those rules limits.
