// modification of PreemptionLimits or currently tracked preemptions, caused by
// user actions (e.g. delete of a limit resource).
//
// Moreover, snapshot allows to update the underlying captured state via Record
// method, to take into account additional preemptions that were issued after it
// was captured, for example to track preemptions already issued in the same
// scheduling cycle.
